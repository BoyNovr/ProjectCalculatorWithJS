The calculator project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its features include a display for inputted numbers and their results, input history, and temporary results. We utilize the DOM to fetch values from each element. Additionally, the project allows users to use their computer keyboard for input, enhancing user experience by providing a convenient alternative to on-screen number selection.
